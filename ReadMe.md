First run ServerApplication and then Client or Admin applications.

Our project currently includes two semi functioning JavaFX applications.

The Server Application is mulithreaded and can therefor accept multiple instances of Client and Admin Applications.

Admin Application Features:
Add Players
Add Teams
Add Matches
Add Referees
Create Matches

Client Application Features:
List Upcoming Matches
List Matches on Date
List Team Matches

Bugs & TODO:
Exception handling needs work in some cases ie: when the user iputs numbers for text fields that take string

Listing matches is currently not formatting right. Still need to add proper columns and selecting features

Adding new country needs to throw an exception when a string that is not a country is entered.

UI needs a lot of work. Some tabs can be simplified into one. 

Window size needs to be adjusted

Load and save file need a list directory
